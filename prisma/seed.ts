                        <p>The woven cane gives it a visible surface, but also provides a sense of depth. You can glimpse what’s inside, adding some careful mystery to the piece. The fact that the design is transparent also fulfils a function. The woven cane ventilates the cupboard which is practical when storing both clothes and electronic devices. A lamp behind the see-through doors makes Air shine like a diamond.</p>`,

            <p>The expression is robust, the form is simple. Bell is a ceiling lamp in an iconic bell shape and with special attention paid to its details. Its round, even surface gives the lamp the impression of having been cast. Rather than being hidden, the meeting between the lead and the lamp is accentuated in a modern and original way.</p \n
            <p>In Bell you have a lamp where the connection between the lead and the lamp is evident. Just as light is a gatherer, the bell has historically been used to call people to come together - to gather people. With its bell shape, Bell can also be used to create a cozy place to gather in the room.</p>`,
